  <h1>Inspiration:</h1>
  <p>Since I did not have much idea of what to do, I choose what I am most familiar with: procrastination. And hopefully it will help others to get through their life as well </p>

  <p>Disclaimer: Although the website seems to promote procrastination, I did take the project seriously</p>
